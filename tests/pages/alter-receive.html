<h2>Alter on receive</h2>

<p>Tests if altering the body and title on the <em>receive</em> event works.

<p><a href="?page=alter-receive<?= $append ?>#alter">Test it</a> (<a href="?page=alter-receive<?= $append ?>">no alteration</a>)

<p id="to_alter">This will be altered. Currently this is not.

<p>The title should also be altered.
